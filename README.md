## Installation
Install the necessary dependencies with pip if running from source

2. Ensure registration files do not contain the word "template" in any form
3. Ensure generated files are not open in any program
4. Run the script with `python main.py` or the appropriate executable (i.e. `hfest.exe` or `tsgc.exe`) if using a binary
5. Generated files can be found in the `output/` directory
